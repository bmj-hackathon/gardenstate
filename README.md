# gardenstate
Tracking the state of 100 ERC 721 NFT flower tokens, 
generating statistics and market information so you can become the next Flower Baron.

## The story so far ...

A simple python script to scrape the hashbase.io json files, convert to Pandas dataframe (yes it's overkill) and save to `.csv`. 

You can also use the `npm dat` package at the command line. 

## Roadmap
 - [x] Get the flower json data
 - [ ] Integrate with on-chain market transactions
 - [ ] Get the images
 - [ ] Train a CNN on the data
